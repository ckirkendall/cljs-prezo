<h3>Clojure is <u>Not</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>A Better Java - Scala is often said to "a better Java" and it certainly is and then some. 
Where Scala allows the developer to continue think the same way, Clojure does not.  Clojure 
and lisps in general require the developer re-wire the brain a bit.  While this may sounds like 
a negative at first, this re-wiring has benefits way beyond Clojure for the developer. </li>
